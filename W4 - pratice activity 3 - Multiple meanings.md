Leia o trecho a seguir:

"When it comes to words with multiple meanings, it's wise to read and re-read those sentences. The wrong form can change your meaning. And it doesn't matter what medium you're writing in. Words with multiple meanings creep up all the time. If you're working on an essay for school, check out How to Write an Essay. If you're more focused on short fiction, take a look at How to Write a Short Story. Until then, happy shapeshifting!"

É importante ler e reler os textos porque as palavras mudam de sentido ao longo do tempo e de acordo com o tipo de texto.

Respostas:

a.

b. 

É importante ler e reler os textos porque as palavras mudam de sentido ao longo do tempo e de acordo com o tipo de texto.

c. 

“_Happy shapeshifting_” significa que você precisa observar onde as palavras estão, pois em uma redação (_essay_) o sentido será sempre diferente do de um conto (_short story_).

![Correta](https://ava.univesp.br/images/ci/icons/check.gif)d. 

O texto é sobre palavras com sentidos múltiplos e “_shapeshift_” significa que as palavras assumem “uma diferente forma”, ou seja, um sentido diverso.

e. 

As palavras usadas em uma redação (_essay_) serão sempre diferentes das palavras usadas em um conto (_short story_), por isso o termo “_shapeshifting_”.

Leia o seguinte trecho da _TED talk_ “_The benefits of a billingual brain_”: 

Finally, Gabriella's parents are likely to be subordinate bilinguals who learn a secondary language by filtering it through their primary language. Because all types of bilingual people can become fully proficient in a language regardless of accent or pronunciation, the difference may not be apparent to a casual observer. But recent advances in brain imaging technology have given neurolinguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language learning affect the bilingual brain.

Considerando que o trecho reporta como a pesquisa foi realizada, complete corretamente as lacunas do seguinte abstract:

  
“Digital and print readings differ in their affordances. Past research supports a print advantage, but few studies have used within-subjects approaches or compared handheld devices and multiple reading genres. We compared college students’ reading of several excerpts on paper, a laptop, and an e-reader. Students **[1]** on all platforms, **[2]** comprehension tasks, and **[3]** questions on their perceptions and preferences. Results indicated that students’ learning experience with print was superior, with the laptop a close second. In contrast, students’ learning from and perceptions of the e-reader were lower. There was no interaction with reading genre. This research suggests that students’ preference for print remains strong. When digital materials are used, e-readers appear to be a less viable option for academics relative to laptops.”
