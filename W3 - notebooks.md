## **MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE TYPES OF ENGLISH:**

The most obvious difference between the British, Australian and American English is in the accent (or pronunciation), especially with vowel sounds.

For example, American English uses a clear “r” sound (especially at end of words) and Australian and British English don’t pronounce a clear /r/ sound (especially the end of a word or syllable). In Australian or Britain the word “car” would be pronounced without the final “r” sound (i.e. “ca”) and “warmer” would be pronounced without the middle “r” sound  (i.e. /wamer/).

Another major difference between American English and British or Australian English is the intonation when asking questions. One’s voice goes up at the end of a yes or no question with American English, but with Australian and British English one’s voice goes down.

There are also some major difference between vocabulary and spelling with the three different types of English. For example, in the United States and Britain they call two pieces of bread with a protein or vegetable in the middle a “sandwich” and in Australia they call this a “sanga.”
	
Below is a list of popular phrases or words that are commonly used in these three different English-speaking countries.
