## Modal meaning

We often use modal verbs or other modal expressions when we want to express an opinion or attitude about a possible fact or to control a possible action. All modal expressions are about the speaker’s or writer’s view of the world.

Compare



> _He’s her brother. She told me_|I know this fact for certain. I am not expressing an opinion about it. I am stating it as a fact.
---|---|
>_He must be her brother. They look so much alike._|I am expressing an opinion about a fact because of the evidence that I have.

> _Jan always goes with us._|I’m not expressing an attitude or opinion about this action.
---|---|
> _OK. Jan can go if she’s finished._|I’m controlling a possible action. I’m giving Jan permission.

We can divide most modal words and expressions into two types of meaning:

-   The speaker or writer decides how certain something is, either in the present, future or past. They predict or speculate about a fact. We see this type of meaning when we talk about degrees of certainty, possibility, likelihood, doubt:
    

> _Paula **can’t** be home yet. It’s **impossible**. She left 10 minutes after us._

[The speaker hears the phone ring and predicts who is ringing.]

> _There’s the phone. That’**ll** be Mum._

> _I **may** go. I haven’t decided yet._

-   The speaker or writer wants to control or ‘direct’ the action. They give and refuse permission. They talk about obligation and necessity. They talk about how they would like the world to be:
    

[parent says to child]

> _You **can** come if you’re good._

> _He **should** take more care._

> _Tell Jen she **needn’t** bother about the washing up._

> _You **mustn’t** worry so much about her._

> _You **may** go now._ (formal)

## Modal verbs

Often the same modal verb is used to express different meanings.
