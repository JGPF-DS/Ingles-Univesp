6.  Consider the questions that were shown in the videoclass to think about your own culture. Imagine you are talking about this with participants of the conference from other countries. Can you give an overview of your culture (Brazilian or the state/city you live in)?  
    [Considerando as questões apresentadas na videoaula e pense sobre a sua cultura. Imagine que você está falando sobre isso com participantes de um congresso de outros países. Você consegue dar uma ideia geral sobre sua cultura (brasileira ou do estado/cidade em que você vive)?]  
    
    -   What is considered good and bad?
    -   How are families structured?
    -   Which traditions are important?
    -   How does communication work?
    -   How do people react to other cultures?
    -   What is humour like?
    
    **RESPOSTA:**
    
    Personal answers. Examples: It’s good practice to greet with a handshake, kiss or hug. Families are very important, Brazilians usually visit their parents/relatives on weekends or have lunch together on Sundays. We communicate a lot with friends and family in text, via apps or social media. We sometimes find other cultures “cold” because Brazilians are friendly and touching a person’s arm, for example, when having a conversation is very common, so it’s hard for us to be in contact with people from other countries who don’t have physical contact. However, Brazilians are very understanding and we usually adapt to the other person’s habits. Humor is paramount in Brazil.

    1.  Verb “be” in the simple present – interrogative, affirmative and negative
    2.  Other verbs in the simple present – affirmative and negative
    3.  Verbs in the third person in the simple present
    
    **English as a lingua franca**
    
    What is English as a lingua franca?
    
    English as a lingua franca (ELF) refers to the use of English as a common means of communication among people with different mother tongues. For instance, a Danish tourist in Athens asking a Greek passer-by for directions; a French teacher discussing with a Spanish colleague during an international conference in Oslo; a group of Italian students chatting with Portuguese and Turkish students via Skype about their eTwinning programme; German, Chinese and Hungarian co-players sending each other online messages about their team’s future strategy in the game: they all communicate in English as a lingua franca.
    
    Why is using English as a lingua franca important?
    
    Nowadays, English is the most widely employed language in Europe and beyond and, very frequently, the only option for people who do not share their mother tongue or have another language in common. Using it is important not only for personal communication in various social domains, including the Internet, but also, for professional reasons. It is a ‘shared’ language, in other words, that opens doors for better social and professional opportunities.
